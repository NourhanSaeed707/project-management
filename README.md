# Project Management
## Introduction:
- This project is a Project Management System built using Java Spring Boot and MySQL. It provides a robust and scalable platform for managing projects, tasks, and associated data. Designed with a clean and intuitive architecture, this CRUD-based application allows users to create, read, update, and delete project details seamlessly. Its purpose is to streamline project management processes and ensure data consistency across all operations.

## Features:
1- Comprehensive CRUD Operations
Create new projects with detailed attributes like name, description, start date, end date, and status.
View project details, including tasks and associated metadata.
Update existing project details with real-time validations.
Delete projects with safeguards to prevent accidental data loss.

2- User-Friendly API Endpoints
Well-documented RESTful APIs for seamless integration with frontend applications.
Pagination and filtering capabilities for efficient data retrieval.

3- Data Consistency and Validation
Integrated backend validations ensure data integrity.
Transaction management to prevent partial updates or data corruption.

4- MySQL Integration
A relational database structure for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
Support for complex queries and relational mappings.

## Technologies Used:
1- Backend Framework: Java Spring Boot
Provides robust support for dependency injection, RESTful APIs, and database integration.

2- Database: MySQL
A powerful relational database for storing structured project and task data.

3- ORM: Hibernate/JPA

4- Build Tool: Maven

5- Tools and Libraries:
Lombok: For reducing boilerplate code (e.g., getters/setters).
Spring Data JPA: For CRUD operations and query execution.
Spring Boot DevTools: For efficient development and hot reloading.

## Conclusion
This Project Management System is a foundational application demonstrating the power and flexibility of modern backend technologies like Java Spring Boot and MySQL. Its clean architecture, robust features, and scalable design make it an ideal solution for small-to-medium scale project management needs. This project also serves as a strong starting point for developers looking to build more advanced features or integrate additional services.
